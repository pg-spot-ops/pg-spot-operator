# Main features

* Uses cheap (3-10x compared to on-demand pricing) AWS Spot VMs to run Postgres
* Installs Postgres from official PGDG repos, meaning you get instant minor version updates
* Supports Postgres versions v14-v17 (defaults to v16 currently if not specified)
* Two instance selection strategies - "cheapest" and "random"
  - Note that `--selection-strategy=random` can produce better eviction rates as cheaper instance types are in more danger
  of being overbooked. For the same reason burstable instances are not recommended at all for real work.
* Allows also to explicitly specify a list of preferred instance types and cheapest used
* Uses Debian 12 base images / AMI-s
* Allows override of ALL `postgresql.conf` settings if user wishes so
* Built-in basic Postgres tuning profiles for most common workloads (default, oltp, analytics, web)
* Maintains a single instance per daemon to keep things simple
* Supports a single EBS volume or all local/volatile instance disks in a volume group
* Tunable EBS volume performance via paid IOPS/throughput
* Supports block level S3 backups/restores via pgBackRest, meaning acceptable RPO possible even with instance storage
* Can up/down-size the CPU/RAM requests
* Can time-limit the instance lifetime via `--expiration-date "2024-10-22 00:00+03"`, after which it auto-terminates
  given the daemon is running
* Fire-and-forget/self-terminating mode for the VM to expire itself automatically on expiration date
* Optional on-the-VM detailed hardware monitoring support via node_exporter + Grafana

## Non-features

* No automated major version upgrades (stop the engine, do some magic, update the manifest `postgresql.version`)
* No persistent state keeping by default - relying on a local SQLite DB file. User can solve that though by setting
  `--config-dir` to some persistent volume for example. Without that some superfluous work will be performed and
  instance state change and pricing history will be lost, in case of the engine node loss.
* No automatic EBS volume growth (can do manually still)
* DNS integration - all communication happening over IP for now
* No full railguards regarding user input - undefined behaviour for example if user changes region or zone after 1st init
